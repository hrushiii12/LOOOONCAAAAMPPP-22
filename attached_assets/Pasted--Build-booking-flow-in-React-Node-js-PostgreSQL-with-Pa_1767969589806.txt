**Build booking flow in React + Node.js + PostgreSQL with Paytm payment and WhatsApp Cloud API automation:**

1. Customer fills booking form and proceeds to Paytm payment.
2. After successful payment:

   * Create booking record in PostgreSQL
   * Send WhatsApp message to customer:
     “Payment successful — booking processing — e-ticket will be sent within 60 minutes”
3. Send booking request WhatsApp message to Property Owner with buttons:

   * Confirm
   * Cancel
4. Send booking request notification to Admin WhatsApp.
5. Create webhook to receive owner response:

   * If Confirm:
     a) Generate unique e-ticket link webpage
     b) e-ticket expires after checkout date
     c) send WhatsApp confirmation + e-ticket link to customer
     d) notify admin as confirmed
   * If Cancel:
     a) notify customer cancellation/refund message
     b) notify admin cancellation/refund assistance
6. Booking database statuses:

   * PAYMENT_SUCCESS
   * BOOKING_REQUEST_SENT_TO_OWNER
   * OWNER_CONFIRMED or OWNER_CANCELLED
   * TICKET_GENERATED or REFUND_REQUIRED

WhatsApp must use approved template messages.

> Build complete booking flow using React + Node.js + PostgreSQL with a DEMO payment gateway page (not real Paytm yet).
> The demo payment page should simulate:
> – Payment Success
> – Payment Failed
> – Payment Pending
>
> On simulated success, backend should behave exactly like real Paytm success:
> – create booking record in DB
> – run WhatsApp Cloud API message flows
> – trigger owner confirmation step
> – generate e-ticket page link on confirmation
>
> Later I will replace demo gateway with Paytm All-in-One, so please keep payment logic modular.

I will handle Meta Business verification and create WhatsApp Cloud API setup myself.
Please build integration in Node.js that uses:
– WhatsApp Cloud API
– incoming webhooks for owner button replies
– outgoing template messages to customer, owner, admin.

For now, use environment variables like:
– WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID
– WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID
– WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN

I will fill these values later from my Meta account.

 # Remember  :

don’t try to create Meta account

leave credentials empty

code integration normally
